### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because prior to this lab, I had never known the rules of Blackjack. I found it really fun learning a new card game for the sole purpose of recreating that card game in code. Learning all the rules of Blackjack made me interested in learning how to play the game outside of the lab. 

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was something that I found enjoyment in because it was simple yet informative. Learning how to output information that was given by the user is a fundamental topic in c++. I would say that this lab was important because it covered an important topic regarding insertion and extraction operators. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was the lab that actually stumped me at first. It took me a while to figure out how to validate the amount of given command line arguments. I enjoyed making the code for the parking rules with my partner. This lab was one of my favorites because it made me think about how the functions should execute in order to properly inform the user if they could park on a specific street.
